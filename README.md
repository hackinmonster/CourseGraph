This is a small project of mine aimed at helping students visualize their plan of study. Currently, the best alternative for course planning is to use DegreeWorks, which lists required courses by category (major, electives, etc), but this lacks visualization features, making it difficult to mentally map out a plan. 

I designed this project as a solution to that very problem. Using this tool, students can pick their program and the courses they've taken, and automatically generate a tree-like visualization, mapping out which courses they can take, and when. Each arrow points from a prerequisite to a requisite, with earlier classes being toward the left, and later toward the right.



Here, I have a prototype just to give a general idea of what the graph will look like. It's not yet accurate or well-designed, but it was generated within seconds using data scraped from the UNC Charlotte course catalog. The final version will utilize color, better spacing, and filtering to make it more understandable.
